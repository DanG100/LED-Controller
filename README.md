# LED-Controller [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DanG100/LED-Controller.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DanG100/LED-Controller) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xdv7fd7gdilt5tg5/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/DanG100/led-controller/branch/master)

This project uses Qt and an Arduino to control WS2812 bases LEDs. Control provided through a desktop application which commuunicates over serial to the arduino. This allows customization of the LED behavior without any code changes.

Project currently on hold, barring some electrical difficulties with LEDs.
